Global-Map
==========

This repository contains two folders: Mapbox.js Webpage and LeafletJS webpage. 
They both produce an interactive map of the world using similar techniques.

Differences
==========

The main differences are the JavaScript libraries used to create the map in both cases. Mapbox.js uses mapbox.js and 
LeafletJS uses Leaflet.js. The former runs well under WebKit browsers but falls short under Firefox or IE. 

The latter however works under all browsers. IE has some difficulties in rendering the interactive layer however this
will be fixed in due course once further features are added.
